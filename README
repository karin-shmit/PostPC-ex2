hypothetical question-
In order to add the multiplication feature we will need several things:
1. implement the method in the calculator implementation
2. add button of x as TextView in activity_main.xml and arange all the buttons so the x button will have space on the screen
3. find the veiw in MainActivity.java and set OnClickListener
4. add test to the multiplication in the SimpleCalculatorImpTest, see that the method works properly
5. add test to the multiplication in the AppFlow, see that the button works properly
6. add test to the multiplication in the MainActivityTest, see that the all the things works together properly
